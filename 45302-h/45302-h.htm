      he knows such thrifty, diligent people never destroy the trees; and he
      often tells the forester to order the workmen to leave as many of the

      The little girls like to pay him a visit, for he is such a very funny
      bird. He is pure white, with such a lovely yellow crest; and when he is
      pleased, he makes it stand up on his head till you can see every feather
      quite distinctly. Unfortunately, when he does that he almost always gives
      a terribly loud screech, which forces you to put your hands to your ears
      to shut out the ugly sound. When he gets a piece of sugar, or a bit of the
      yolk of an egg, he is so pleased, and makes a sound like giving you a
      kiss, to show his thanks. I hope the little girl who is holding up her

      give her a severe bite.

      glad to say there are no slaves in America now; and the overseer dare not
      use that great long whip to force them to work, as he did only a very few
      years ago. These men have been sent to tie up and whip one of the women,
      because she did not do as much work as the overseer thought she ought to
      have done. How glad the negroes must be now to think they cannot be
      whipped, or sold away from their children and homes; and that they can
